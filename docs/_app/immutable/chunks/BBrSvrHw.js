The fisherman got 3 different states depending on if its idle, fishing or catching.
A button was added that switched from idle to fishing state, then after a fixed time it switched to catching state. When pressing the catch button it switched back to idle state.
A list of fish with sizes and prices were added and when the catch button was pressed a random one was console logged.
A red and green hitline was added with a back and forth moving arrow. The catch button was reworked to only give a fish if pressed while the arrow is in the green area of the hitline.
an inventory was added that adds the fish instead of logging them and a few new fish were added.
A shop was added with a new background a a few fishing rods that dont do anything yet.`;return{c(){e=c("p"),e.textContent=g,o=u(),a=c("p"),a.textContent=w,h=u(),n=c("p"),n.textContent=p},l(t){e=r(t,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),f(e)!=="svelte-po6jm8"&&(e.textContent=g),o=m(t),a=r(t,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),f(a)!=="svelte-11xgp41"&&(a.textContent=w),h=m(t),n=r(t,"P",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),f(n)!=="svelte-7snpmq"&&(n.textContent=p)},m(t,s){d(t,e,s),d(t,o,s),d(t,a,s),d(t,h,s),d(t,n,s)},p:l,i:l,o:l,d(t){t&&(i(e),i(o),i(a),i(h),i(n))}}}const k={title:"Första bloginlägg (devblog 1+2)",date:"2025-05-07"},{title:T,date:P}=k;class q extends v{constructor(e){super(),C(this,e,null,_,x,{})}}export{q as default,k as metadata};
